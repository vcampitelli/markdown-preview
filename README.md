This is a very simple repository that uses [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to render HTML markup from a markdown text and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to highlight code blocks.

There is a ton of websites and plugins for your favorite IDE that can do much better - like inserting images and having a formatting toolbar.

I just wanted the simplest way possible to change the stylesheet and export the output as an HTML or PDF file.

I also didn't want to depend on npm, so I've hardcoded both dependencies directly from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/).

This way, you just have to open `index.html` file directly from your browser.
